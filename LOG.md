- Wow. finally got a good working webpack. Holy fuck that was way harder than it needed to be.

- whatever moron decided that the `entry` property in `webpack.config.js`  _must_ be proceded by a `./` or else it is interpreted as a 'module entry' that will be resolved in `node_modules` know that you have caused endless hours of frustration and confusion. Also webpack should display errors by default instead of hiding them behind crap like `--display-error-details` (WTF?). Also the error for this isn't helpful at all...GRRR.....

- Going to start with three.js 
	- I'm enchanted by the prospect of upgrading to 3d for this project or using cool 3d effects.

- narrowing down graphics engines
	- three.js
		- bit inspired by the ascii demo...maybe just do ascii, who needs fancy graphics?

	- pixie.js

- Settled on the network-effect idea.
- Think I'm going to go straight javascript/html instead of Unity to begin.
