# Friender

A game about helping friends meet! 

I wrote this over the a weekend for [Ludum Dare 38](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38)

## Playing

## Building

Prerequisites
- docker
- some unix-like OS (I use mac)

To build just checkout this repository run the command:

```
./build
```

Docker is so that you don't to have various node/webpack etc dependencies. However, if you _do_ have those things installed odds are that this project will build via a simple `webpack` command.

Images are generated 'by hand' via the `get-avatars` command in the [utils](./utils) folder and copying them over into `src/img/64`. I'm using the work of a most excellent [avatar-generator](https://github.com/arusanov/avatar-generator) for these lovely little avatars.
